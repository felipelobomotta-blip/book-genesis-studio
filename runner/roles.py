"""Discover what is installed and assign every role and every panel seat (ADR 0002).

The configured map in runner/config/models.yaml is a preference, not a requirement: a
role whose adapter is not on this machine falls back to what is. The judge prefers a
different family than the writer; when only one family exists the judge takes a
different model and the plan carries a "single family" warning that ends up in
RUN_REPORT.md. Nothing here reads an API key.
