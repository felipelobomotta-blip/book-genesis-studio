# Architecture -- Book Genesis V4

> Current note: the default workflow for new projects is now the Universal Book Genesis Core (`skills/book-genesis/`). This document remains the legacy V4/V5 architecture reference. See `docs/book-genesis-codex.md` for the portable agent pipeline.

Book Genesis V4.1 is a 17-phase pipeline (with sub-phases) that transforms a one-sentence idea into a commercially viable, publishable manuscript. V4 was built from the ground up after a 5-genre stress test (SYSTEM-ANALYSIS.md) identified 9 structural problems in V2. V4.1 adds 8 skills, doubles the phase count, and introduces fully autonomous execution via `/book-auto`. Every architectural change traces back to a specific failure in the system analysis or lessons learned from real manuscript iterations.

## The Two Scoring Systems

V4 introduces a critical separation between two measures that V2 conflated:

### Genesis Score -- Governs Revision Priority

The Genesis Score is the craft quality measure. It has 7 dimensions, uses a FLOOR system (score = weakest dimension), and determines what gets revised first.

- If Emotion is 7.0 and Prose is 8.5, Emotion gets revision priority.
- The floor must reach the genre-adjusted threshold (7.0-7.5 depending on genre) before the pipeline can advance to delivery.
- The Genesis Score tells you HOW GOOD the book is.

### CVI (Commercial Viability Index) -- Governs Submission Readiness

CVI is the market measure. It predicts whether the book will sell, not whether it is well-crafted.

- **CVI-Launch** predicts first-year sales. 6 inputs: market timing, comp title freshness, hook strength, platform/audience, pacing score, genre convention compliance.
- **CVI-Legacy** predicts 20-year sales. 5 inputs: re-readability, emotional resonance, shareability, identity effect, cultural vocabulary penetration.

A book can have a Genesis Score of 8.5 (strong craft) but a CVI-Launch of 5.0 (bad market timing, no platform). Or a Genesis Score of 7.5 (decent craft) but a CVI-Launch of 8.0 (perfect market moment, huge audience).

**The Genesis Score tells you to keep revising. The CVI tells you when to stop revising and ship.**

---

## State Management

State is managed via `STATE.yaml` (renamed from `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` in V4 for brevity):

- **STATE.yaml is the source of truth.** Every agent reads it at the start of work and writes to it at the end.
- **CHECK-IN** at the start of every session: reads state, reports progress, verifies consistency.
- **CHECK-OUT** at the end of every session: updates state, logs decisions, manages handoffs.
- **Decision Log**: every significant decision recorded with justification and reversibility.
- **Handoff Tracking**: inter-skill tasks with priority and staleness alerts (>2 sessions).
- **Session Recovery**: if context is lost, STATE.yaml contains everything needed to resume.
- **Chapter Reports**: each chapter's writer self-report and disruption report are tracked.
- **Score History**: full Genesis Score + CVI history with per-dimension evidence.

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Where | Condition | Failure Action |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Direction Approval | Phase 1 -> 1.5 | User approves research direction | Revise research |
| Persona Validation | Phase 1.5 -> 2 | PRIMARY + HOSTILE personas defined | Revise personas |
| Foundation Approval | Phase 2 -> 2.5 | User approves foundation + outline | Revise foundation |
| Voice DNA Approval | Phase 2.5 -> 2.7 | Voice DNA with per-character specs approved | Revise voice DNA |
| Entity State Built | Phase 2.7 -> 2.8 | ENTITY_STATE.yaml created with all foundation entities | Rebuild YAML |
| Outline Continuity | Phase 2.8 -> 3 | No CRITICAL continuity issues | Fix outline |
| Anti-AI Check | Phase 3 (per chapter) | 20-pattern scan passes genre threshold | Revise chapter prose |
| Writer Self-Report | Phase 3 -> 3.1 | Report filed with chaos moments, ugly sentence, anchor | Rewrite chapter |
| Dialogue Test | Phase 3.1 -> 3.2 | Cover-the-name test passes | Polish dialogue |
| Hook Score | Phase 3.2 -> 3.5 | Hook and pull scores above threshold | Rewrite opening/ending |
| Disruption Review | Phase 3.5 -> 3.8 | Writer reviews disruptions | Accept/reject changes |
| Mechanical Clean | Phase 3.8 -> 4 | Pattern counts within genre targets | Re-run mechanical pass |
| Casual Reader Gate | Phase 4 | "Would an airport reader give this 10 pages?" | Revise hook/pacing |
| Memory Test | Phase 4 | "What would the reader remember tomorrow?" | Strengthen anchor |
| Genesis Floor | Phase 4 -> 4.5 | Floor >= genre threshold (7.0-7.5) | Enter quality gate loop |
| Quality Gate | Phase 4.5 -> 5 or 6 | Pass after max 3 iterations | Escalate to orchestrator |
| Entity State Updated | Phase 5.5 -> 5.6 | ENTITY_STATE.yaml reflects all revisions | Re-run entity update |
| Manuscript Continuity | Phase 5.6 -> 6 | No CRITICAL cross-chapter issues | Fix inconsistencies |
| CVI-Launch Gate | Phase 6 | CVI-Launch >= 7.0 | Revise market positioning |

---

## Loop-Back Rules

The pipeline is not linear. These are the sanctioned backward jumps:

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| Phase 3 (Writing) | Phase 2 (Foundation) | Character evolves beyond outline; outline needs restructuring |
| Phase 3 (Writing) | Phase 1 (Research) | Insufficient data for non-fiction chapter |
| Phase 4 (Evaluation) | Phase 5 (Revision) | Floor below genre threshold (7.0-7.5) |
| Phase 5 (Revision) | Phase 4 (Evaluation) | After every revision cycle (re-evaluate) |
| Phase 5 (Revision) | Phase 2 (Foundation) | 3 revision cycles without floor improvement (structural problem) |
| Phase 6 (Delivery) | Phase 5 (Revision) | CVI-Launch < 7.0 (market positioning issue) |

**Hard rule:** Maximum 3 revision cycles per evaluation round. If the floor does not improve after 3 cycles, the problem is structural -- return to Phase 2.

---

## The Casual Reader Gate

This is V4's most commercially important addition. It was identified as a missing architectural element in the system analysis.

The Casual Reader is not the Devourer (who reads fast and feels everything), the Critic (who analyzes), or the Hostile (who attacks). The Casual Reader is the person who picks up a book at an airport, reads 10 pages, and decides based on vibes. Not craft. Vibes.

The Casual Reader does not care about:
- Thematic depth
- Prose quality
- Character psychology
- Anti-AI compliance

The Casual Reader cares about:
- "Am I curious?"
- "Do I like this person's voice?"
- "Is something happening?"
- "Do I want to know what happens next?"

If the Casual Reader would put the book down, the chapter fails -- regardless of its Genesis Score. This gate exists because pacing is the #2 predictor of commercial success, and a book with 7.5 prose + 9.0 pacing outsells 9.0 prose + 7.5 pacing by 10x.

## Autonomous Mode (NEW in V4.1)

V4.1 introduces `/book-auto`, which replaces 150+ manual skill invocations with a single command. The `book-auto` skill dispatches the `book-genesis` orchestrator agent with 200 turns of autonomous execution.

**3 Human Checkpoints:**
1. **Foundation checkpoint** (after Phase 2.8): User approves research direction, reader personas, foundation, outline, voice DNA, entity state, and continuity report before any writing begins.
2. **Manuscript checkpoint** (after Phase 5.6): User reviews the complete revised manuscript, entity state, and continuity report before delivery packaging begins.
3. **Delivery checkpoint** (after Phase 6): User approves the final editorial package before submission.

Everything between checkpoints runs automatically: writing, dialogue polish, hook craft, disruption, mechanical preprocessing, evaluation, quality gate loops, revision, and continuity audits.

**Invocation:** `/book-auto [language] [idea]`
