# Agent Instructions

This repository contains Book Genesis, an agent-agnostic book-production workflow made of markdown skills, manifests, prompts, scoring rules, and reference files.

## Default Behavior

When asked to create, plan, draft, audit, score, revise, or package a book, use the Universal Book Genesis Core unless the user explicitly asks for legacy V4/V5:

```text
skills/book-genesis/SKILL.md
```

Treat this as the current universal pipeline for Claude Code, Codex, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, Pi, Windsurf/Cascade, Gemini CLI, Kimi Code, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Antigravity, and other file-aware agents. `skills/book-genesis-codex/` remains only as a compatibility package. A supported installer target does not establish complete-book acceptance; consult `docs/compatibility.md` for evidence.

When the user asks for bestseller-level, market-ready, agent/editor-ready, or launch-ready work, layer the market umbrella skill on top of the universal core:

```text
skills/book-bestseller-studio/SKILL.md
```

When the user asks for MiroFish-style reader swarms, public-opinion simulation, niche-risk scouting, or many simulated readers, use:

```text
skills/book-swarm-panel/SKILL.md
```

Load the manifest before advancing phases:

```text
skills/book-genesis/references/pipeline/manifest.yaml
```

## Rules

- Persist important decisions to files.
- Keep `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` synchronized with reality.
- Keep `ASSUMPTIONS.md` explicit.
- Load only the prompt for the active phase.
- Do not skip Phase 4: Adversarial Audit.
- Do not run final scoring before the adversarial audit.
- Write Portuguese artifacts and prose in Portuguese when the book is in Portuguese.
- Treat legacy V4 material as historical reference unless the user asks for it.

## Agent-Specific Notes

- Claude Code can run `/book-genesis` after installing the portable suite.
- Codex can use this repo directly through `AGENTS.md` and the skill folder.
- Antigravity can use this file as the repo-level playbook.
- Kimi Code can run `/skill:book-genesis` after installing the portable suite.
- The maintainer-only installer/verifier in `runner/installer.py` can validate the package and prepare files; it does not call a model or write literary output. Book Genesis 5.0 has no interactive book-generation CLI.

- OpenClaw and Hermes Agent load the same installed skills; ask the host to use `book-genesis` in a writable book-project workspace.

## Commands

- `/book-genesis`: canonical portable pipeline.
- `/book-genesis-full`: full legacy production pipeline.
- `/book-genesis-codex`: historical portable command kept for compatibility.
