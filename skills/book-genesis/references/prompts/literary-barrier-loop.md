# Literary Barrier Revision Loop

You are responsible for coordinating Phase 5 of `book-genesis`.

## Goal

Raise the manuscript until its calibrated literary critical score is above the target threshold, defaulting to 8.5 when the user does not specify another number.

This phase exists because a manuscript can pass ordinary structure checks and still fail as literature. The loop targets the ceiling: voice, residue, risk, character contradiction, thematic pressure, and reader memory.

## Inputs

Read:

- `artifacts/08-adversarial-audit.md`
- `references/scoring/evaluator-protocol.md`
- all manuscript chapters
- foundation and architecture artifacts
- the latest Genesis Score report if one already exists
- prior files in `evaluations/` if this is not the first loop

## Role Separation

Do not let one context both revise and approve its own revision when isolated subagents are available.

1. At least three `blind_literary_critic` instances score and create evidence-backed reports.
2. A revision editor receives the tickets and manuscript, but not the desired numeric result.
3. A fresh blind evaluator rescores the revised manuscript.
4. The orchestrator applies calibration and the threshold after evaluator reports exist.

When the runtime cannot isolate contexts, mark Evaluation Independence Grade `C`. Grade C can guide revision but cannot support a strong independent-quality claim.

## Calibration Rule

Internal evaluation is biased upward. Before deciding that the book cleared the barrier:

1. collect separate evaluator reports before revealing the target threshold
2. use the median score for each lens
3. subtract 0.8 from each lens median unless external human critique is attached in `evaluations/`
4. use the lowest calibrated lens as the Literary Barrier Score
5. send disagreements of 1.5 points or more to another evaluator instead of averaging them away

Do not claim the threshold was reached unless the calibrated floor is above the target.

## Critical Lenses

Score and diagnose these lenses separately:

1. Line: sentence quality, rhythm, precision, image pressure, absence of generic polish
2. Voice: recognizability, durability over pages, resistance to synthetic sameness
3. Character: contradiction, memory, self-sabotage, behavior under pressure
4. Structure: chapter necessity, escalation, reversals, payoff, reread architecture
5. Theme: lived inquiry, subtext, moral/intellectual pressure, no lecture residue
6. Emotion: earned feeling, aftertaste, embodied reaction, non-obvious residue
7. Originality: premise, execution, lens, refusal of stale genre defaults

## Loop

Repeat until the calibrated Literary Barrier Score is above target or a blocker is explicit:

1. Prepare `blind_literary_critic` packet and dispatch at least three fresh instances under `evaluator-protocol.md`.
2. Identify the lowest scoring lens from evidence-backed reports.
3. Name the exact passages or structural zones causing the ceiling.
4. Write `evaluations/revision-plan.md` using the smallest revision class that can raise the ceiling:
   - structural revision
   - connective revision
   - character deepening
   - voice recalibration
   - line edit
   - cut or merge
5. Dispatch a revision editor to revise the manuscript files directly.
6. Save a revision note in `evaluations/literary-barrier-loop.md`.
7. Dispatch a fresh blind evaluator to rescore all lenses, including any lens that might have been damaged.

## Revision Rules

- Preserve the strongest passages unless they are structurally false.
- Do not add decorative lyricism to chase a literary score.
- Prefer concrete pressure over abstract explanation.
- Prefer scene behavior over thematic statement.
- Prefer one strange true detail over three polished generic sentences.
- If a chapter cannot justify its existence, cut or merge it.
- If a character behaves correctly too often, introduce cost, evasion, contradiction, or self-caused damage.
- If prose sounds smooth but forgettable, add specificity, asymmetry, silence, interruption, or a harder image.

## Stop Conditions

Stop with approval only when:

- calibrated Literary Barrier Score > target
- no critical lens below target
- no Phase 4 finding remains unresolved at major severity
- the revision report cites textual or structural evidence

Stop with blocker only when:

- the manuscript lacks enough draft material to evaluate
- the next improvement requires author decision, lived material, external research, or human critique
- further revision would be speculative churn
- five revision iterations failed to clear the calibrated floor, unless user explicitly raises the limit

## Output

Save or update `evaluations/literary-barrier-loop.md` with:

- target threshold
- iteration number
- lens scores before and after calibration
- lowest lens
- revision actions taken
- passages changed
- strengths preserved
- current verdict: `CONTINUE`, `APPROVED`, or `BLOCKED`

Save or update `evaluations/revision-plan.md` with:

- ticket identifiers and severity
- cited passages or structural zones
- assigned revision class
- strengths that must be preserved
- acceptance evidence required from the next evaluator
